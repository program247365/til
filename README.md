# Kevin B. Ridgway's Today I Learned Site

> Today I Learned, all in one repo...

I've kept a running list of `til` in my [Bear.app](https://bear.app), and I decided to make these public, and add to them here in this repo, and the site at [https://til.kbr.sh/](https://til.kbr.sh).

## TODO

- [] Make a way to search these via Raycast?
- [] Implement better NextSEO - https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration#seo-options
- [] Bring in Tailwind CSS
- [] Organize into folders with subjects
- [] add tag cloud on homepage
