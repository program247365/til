title: "Installing Diesel CLI on macOS with SQLite Support Only"

I was creating [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) app and wante to use the [Diesel](https://docs.rs/diesel/latest/diesel/) crate for the Rust backend.

Installing Diesel with the default `cargo install diesel_cli` tries to install everything. And diesel actually expects you to have the binary for the database you'll be using already installed.

It gave me the error:

```zsh
...lots of clang output...
  = note: ld: library not found for -lmysqlclient
          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
...more output...
```

Which meant it was trying to install the mysqlclient binary which I didn't have or need. Using this invocation of the diesel CLI solved my problem:

```zsh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```
