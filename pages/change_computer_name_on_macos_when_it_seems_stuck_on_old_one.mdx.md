- [macOS - OS X computer name not matching what shows on terminal - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30552/os-x-computer-name-not-matching-what-shows-on-terminal)

This is the only thing that worked when I saw that my old work computer name was showing in the prompt of my new work computer! Crazy.

```zsh
sudo -i
Password:

for n in HostName ComputerName LocalHostName; do
    scutil --set $n <MYNEWHOSTNAMEHERE>
done

exit
```
