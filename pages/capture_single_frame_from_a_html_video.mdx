This is amazing idea similar to my [No Ads Snippet](/no_ads_snippet). But this snippet you paste into the console of
your browser will open a new window with the current frame you're paused on a video site (like YouTube â€“ it works there!),
and allow you you to then right-click and save that sweet frame of video.

Hat tip to the awesome [Dave Rupert for the idea](https://daverupert.com/2022/11/html5-video-capture-frame-still/).

This will come in useful.

```
const v = document.querySelector('video')
let c = document.createElement('canvas')
c.height = v.videoHeight || parseInt(v.style.height)
c.width = v.videoWidth || parseInt(v.style.width)
const ctx = c.getContext('2d')
ctx.drawImage(v, 0, 0)
const wnd = window.open('')
wnd.document.write(`<img src="${c.toDataURL()}"/>`)
```
