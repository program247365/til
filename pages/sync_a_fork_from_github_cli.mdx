I love the Github CLI, it makes a lot of things easier!

One of my favorite ones is `sync` which I did not know about, but assumed it could do. Today I used it and it was wonderful:

```
gh repo sync owner/cli-fork -b BRANCH_NAME
```

And then you know your `upstream` repo is now synced down to your fork.
