title: "Looper + FZF: Choosing and Playing Music from the CLI"
date: 2021-12-13
tag: rust music looper fzf cli
---

- assumes `looper` is installed - this Rust program I created to play music from the CLI, it's called [Looper](https://github.com/program247365/looper).
- assumes `fzf` is installed, if not you can do it like this:

```zsh
brew install fzf

# To install useful key bindings and fuzzy completion:
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

- get all files in my music dir
- pipe to `fzf` with some formatting
- then pipe to my program that plays mp3s correctly with quotes around it

```
mzk () {
  find $HOME/.kev/listen -type f | fzf --height 40% --reverse | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 $HOME/.kev/bin/looper play --url
}
```
