## Buffer Version

```bash
rg '>>>>' -l | xargs vim
```

Explanation:

It uses `rg` and the flag `-l` to only list file paths that contain `>>>>` in them (conflicted files), pipes to `xargs` with splits each one as a param to `vim`.

It will say `X files to edit`. And you'll have all these files open in buffers. I was going throw

- `:ls` command to Vim lists buffers.
- `:bd#n` to close buffer where `#n` is the bugger number ( use ls to get it)
  --------- `:bd2` - delete buffer # 2

## Tabs Version

```bash
rg '>>>>' -l | xargs vim -p
```

- `vim -p a/*.php` opens the same files in tabs
- `gt` and `gT` switch tabs back and forth
- `:q` closes only the current tab
- `:qa` closes everything and exits
- `:tabo` closes everything but the current tab
