This is a short intro to [Git Worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) that I posted to my work Slack at the time. I was so excited to find out about it after I felt like using git a long time.

It's quite a wonderful git feature you should check out.

## Checkout a New Branch on Disk at a Different Location

```
git worktree add -b new-branch ~/code/folder/my-new-folder-name main
```

## Show What's on Disk in That Folder

```
ls -l ~/code/folder
cd ~/code/folder/my-new-folder-name
ls # it's the whole project checked out at HEAD in this directory! No more stashing!
```

## See All Existing Git Worktrees

```
git worktree list
````

That's cool!!!! Linked to the same git repo, you have a physical copy/directory to work in!

You can have your repo checked out at different commits as a directory.
