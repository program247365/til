I have used [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for some time, but I was manually created repos using the web interface on Github.com, and then I was like, "Wait can't I do this quickly on the CLI??".

Yup.

When you're ready to push your local repo to a newly created one on github, you can run the command in the root of the project.

Here's how, you run this command and it has a nice little wizard that it walks you through:

```zsh
gh repo create
```

The output looks like

```zsh
? What would you like to do? Push an existing local repository to GitHub
? Path to local repository .
? Repository name test
? Repository owner program247365
? Description A place to track all your side projects
? Visibility Private
✓ Created repository program247365/test on GitHub
? Add a remote? Yes
? What should the new remote be called? origin
✓ Added remote https://github.com/program247365/test.git
```
