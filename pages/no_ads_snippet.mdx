Sometimes the simplest code is the best code. 

I created this in 2017 originally as 
a [CodePen named "The Best Blank Page Evar"](https://codepen.io/program247365/pen/bGZPRR), but I thought I'd document it here now.

Example usage, IMDB.com often has very fullpage ads that run, and it's annoying since I'm usually just trying to look up who an actor is
in something I'm watching, etc. But run this in the console of your browser, and watch that warlock disappear.

```
//Use this snippet in the console to destroy ads on any page :)

var iframes = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe');
for (var i = 0; i < iframes.length; i++) {
  iframes[i].setAttribute("src", "");
}
```

Note, there is probably some more clever HTML tags to target like `video`, might update this later.
