I've switched to [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) in recent years, and I'm always looking for ways to speed up my workflow.

This command combines NeoVim with the [skim fuzzy finder](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) (written in Rust, obvs). You can swap out
`sk` with `fzf` which you might already have installed.

This allows you to quickly bring up all files in the directory with a fuzzy finder, and then when you press enter on one,
it will open it in NeoVim.

Hawt.

```
nvim $(sk)
```
